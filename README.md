üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python with Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript

AI & Cloud:

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting and services.

Vertex AI for accessing generative models:

Gemini 2.5 Pro: Powers all language understanding, JSON generation, translation, and vision analysis tasks.

Imagen: The underlying model for all image generation and editing functionalities.

Authentication: Firebase Authentication for secure user sign-up and login.

üöÄ How It Works
Authentication: The user signs up or logs in.

Input: The artisan provides a text prompt for a new idea or uploads an image of an existing product.

AI Processing: The Flask backend sends the input to the appropriate Vertex AI models. For bilingual support, content is generated in English and then translated to Hindi by Gemini.

Output: The application displays the results in a clean, structured format, be it a design gallery, a cost analysis, or a product listing.
